As student of Academia-X to become a Software Engineer, I'm presenting to my Instructor and anybody willing to check my Personal Portfolio.
Certainly, to master coding it is necessary to keep writing code for real life situations.
So, My personal Porfolio is my first Project launched to the world of Web Development.
Thanks! Sonia Bullock.
